# This workflow is disabled because the app uses Next.js API routes
# which require a server and cannot be deployed to GitHub Pages.
#
# The app is deployed to Vercel instead, which natively supports
# Next.js server-side features including API routes.
#
# To deploy: Push to main branch and Vercel will automatically deploy.

# Uncomment below to re-enable if you switch to a static-only setup
